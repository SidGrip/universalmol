# UniversalMolecule Core 0.25.2

UniversalMolecule Core 0.25.2 is a release of the UniversalMolecule (UMO) full
node and wallet, rebased onto the Bitcoin Core 25.2 codebase. Source and release
binaries:

  https://github.com/BlueDragon747/universalmol

UniversalMolecule is a Blake-256 (8-round) AuxPoW merge-mined coin in the
BlakeStream family. For network parameters and the full 0.25.2 consensus
details, see `README.md`.

## How to upgrade

Shut down the running wallet/node (`universalmolecule-qt` or
`universalmoleculed`) and wait for it to stop completely, then replace the
binaries (`universalmoleculed`, `universalmolecule-qt`, `universalmolecule-cli`,
`universalmolecule-tx`, `universalmolecule-wallet`) with the 0.25.2 build.
Existing `wallet.dat` and block/chain data are kept.

## Notable changes

- Rebased onto Bitcoin Core 25.2, preserving UniversalMolecule's network magic,
  address formats, AuxPoW (chain ID `0x000F`) merge-mining, subsidy, and
  coinbase maturity rules.
- Dual wallet support: legacy Berkeley DB `wallet.dat` and descriptor SQLite
  wallets.

## Credits

UniversalMolecule Core is built on Bitcoin Core. Thanks to the Bitcoin Core
developers and contributors, and to the UniversalMolecule / BlakeStream
contributors.
